Canteen is an in progress Python web framework.

So far, users can add functions in the following format:

@app.add_route(/hello)
def say_hello():
	return 'Top of the morning'

users can add parameters for a url and the function that is being decorated with the following:

@app.add_route(/hello/<user>)
def say_hello(user):
	return 'Top of the morning, ' + user

users can specify calling functions only for certain HTTP methods by adding to the arguments that are passed to the add_route decorator.  If not specified, the methods will default to only GET:

@app.add_route(/hello/<user>, methods = ['GET', 'POST']
def say_hello(user):
	return 'Top of the morning, ' + user

coming soon:  session management, mime types.
